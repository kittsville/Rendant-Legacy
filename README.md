# Rendant

Rendant co-ordinates requests to analyse Reddit submissions for brigading users. Rendant is part of Raofu, the Reddit brigading detection system.

Rendant uses [Kiits](https://github.com/kittsville/Kiits/), the task runner, to perform the Reddit API calls. Rednant's API can be accessed via [Asrask](https://github.com/kittsville/Asrask/), Raofu's front-end.
